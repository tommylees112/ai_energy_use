Forecast data: 


- US Demand Module: Calculates the total energy demand (2023, 2030) based on base demand and additions like transport, buildings, etc.
- Nuclear Supply Module: Determines the share of nuclear energy in the total energy mix and projects future nuclear demand.
- Fuel Efficiency Module: Computes LEU and HALEU energy output per unit (e.g., TWh/kg) based on fuel efficiency.
- SWU Module: Converts fuel demand into separative work units (SWU) required for enrichment.
- Revenue Module: Calculates revenue from HALEU and LEU fuel supply based on pricing and SWU costs.
